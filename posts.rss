        <title>Farmhack uses small group projects to spark new possibilities.</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@forum]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hackathons are volunteer-driven technology building gatherings usually between 30 to 200 strangers gathering around a certain technology or social problem. Teams form around project ideas, and build them in a day or so. It's a race against the clock to find an idea, make prototype and to demonstrate it at the end of the event. There's usually a judging panel who award a prize.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The true hallmark of understanding is to be able to transfer your knowledge to a new context.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I totally agree with this. There is a big difference between learning, knowledge and understanding. Without understanding, individuals cannot apply knowledge into new scenarios, and thus something new (innovation) cannot be created with what was learnt.</p>
<p>I have seen this in open-source communities, where individuals learn but feel they cannot work in real-world scenarios or companies.</p>
<p>Their ability to work in companies comes when they apply that knowledge through discussions or practice. It is really a beautiful thing to watch.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Agriculture  has been a proving ground for peer learning for quite some time. Peer  learning has been used as a supplementary method to education from  formal extension education. This track record has generated a rich  source of data, and some neat research on what works and how.</p>

From the train station, the village is  towards the mountain ridge with the single, white temple on it. As you  make your way to the top, you’ll see the Pampa Resevoir on one side, and  if you turn back, you can see towards the Indian Ocean, ten kilometres  away.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>What is education? We mostly associate it with systematic instruction. Showing and telling people how it’s done. But is that all there is to education? No. There’s also <a href="http://community.source.institute/t/if-you-can-get-kids-interested-in-math/84">a deeper part, that part of knowing why</a>, discovering what your reason is to appropriate these systematic handlings.</p>

        <title>Who is your Peer?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@forum]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>The term "peers" is commonly used with reference to a group of learners of the same knowledge level and/or discipline. Doctors helping doctors.  Writers giving feedback to writers. This gives the impression that peer interaction is limited to where people with similar backgrounds connect (specific status, age, ability, qualification, etc.).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Whether you're looking to change formal educational settings, work meetings, workshops at startup accelerators, or groups sharing their craft, there is always the temptation to "just make things more interactive". But this is a patch that masks underlying problems. It doesn't fix the program. The intended learning still doesn't happen.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@forum]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>The movement around the Lean Startup methodology began with startup founders only.</p>
<p><a href="http://peerlearning.is/tag/leancamp">Leancamp</a> talks in London were always about practical lessons learned, shared to help other founders.  Andy Young (then founder of a startup called GroupSpaces, now Growth Marketing at Facebook) explained how he learned SQL, a database query language, so that he could build his own analytics dashboard to manage his business. Andreas Klinger (then founder of a fashion startup, now CTO of Product Hunt) gathered everything he could find on "Startup Metrics" and invested a few days to turn it into a slide presentation he shared for free - for the benefit of all founders.</p>
