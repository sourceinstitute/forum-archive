    <title>Trello for organising your tasks and team</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/trello-for-organising-your-tasks-and-team/1267</link>
    <description>Thank you Boyana for introducing me to Trello! I feel like I now have a grip on everything happening. It was just too much on my old system (onenote). It was just madness. 

Sal, I think Trello / Scrum light would be a great addition to the program. 

www.trello.com

It&#39;s free and you can do so much with it. I highly recommend it.

What I&#39;ve done so far that&#39;s working

1. I&#39;ve got a big board for SolarTurtle that I use now to track all my tasks (cards)
2. The board has 5 lists - To Do, Doing, Waiting, Done (sure you can recommend a few more)
3. I started by adding all my current cards to the To Do list. You can just copy and past. It auto generates cards for each new line
4. Then I created labels - one for each of my main projects and key activities - marketing, sales leads, pilot work, etc. etc. 
5. I then added my team. 

Now everyone can see what&#39;s going on and you can easy tag people to talks and set dates etc. Go try it!</description>

<p>Infinitely flexible.  Incredibly easy to use.  Great mobile apps.  It's free.  Trello keeps track of everything, from the big picture to the minute details.</p>
