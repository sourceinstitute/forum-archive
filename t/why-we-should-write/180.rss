    <title>Why we should write</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/why-we-should-write/180</link>
    <description>It seems unnecessary for an entrepreneur to write. But it is actually a very useful tool for mental exercise on your ideas. By writing up what you’ve seen, and what you envisage, you can share your thoughts with others. 

Well it’s more than sharing actually. If you write vividly, with a solid intent in the undertone of your text, you will actually imprint your thoughts, occupying time, space, and emotion in the minds of your reader. Just like my thoughts are seeping into your brain right now, like the coloring of litmus paper, ever so slightly dipped into a liquid

Writing transforms your personal subjective judgment of an idea into a more objective and shareable form. It’s the earliest part of the process of sculpting value for others. 

&gt; Being a writer is a strenuous marriage between careful observation and just as carefully imagining the truths you haven’t been able to see. The rest is the necessary strict toiling with language – John Irving

Writing _is_ hard work, but from my experience time and effort spent on crafting a written image never goes unnoticed. If only one person reads it, it has already doubled your reach, and gives a sense of how to venture further. 

So, I encourage to you to write. It’s a muscle you must flex, and flex frequently to bring its power to full effect. But start! Pull people in. Show us your thinking. Become a Source.</description>
