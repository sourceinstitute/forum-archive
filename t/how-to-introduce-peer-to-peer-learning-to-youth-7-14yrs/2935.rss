    <title>How to introduce peer to peer learning to youth 7-14yrs?</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/how-to-introduce-peer-to-peer-learning-to-youth-7-14yrs/2935</link>
    <description>Has any of you have experience working with little kiddos and how can I introduce them to peer learning among each other?

I am asking because I am in Africa now and my work involves empowering youth and helping with their learning and lifestyle. I&#39;ve attended some of their classes and they are basically copying and pasting what the teachers are writing on the boards and I don&#39;t see it as very effective. The other thing is that among the youngsters the authority and the respect goes to the elders (teachers, mentors, headmasters.) 

Also, I am thinking of gamifying the whole process so it is interesting for them. Something like gamified peer to peer learning. If it makes sense.</description>

<p>Got it, thanks for the ideas we are already working on activities that you mentioned such as soccer, bike, drawing, etc. I like the second one! Kids can be very creative in finding solutions for different problems.</p>

<p>But seriously, kids are kids, and school will be school wherever you go.</p>
<p>I guess there are 2 ways you could go about it.</p>
<p>1 is to discover something great to do together. Maybe a brainstorm where they write things they want to get good at on cards, and the sort them according to group interest and priorities.</p>
<p>After a group sort, plan activities around their priorities (Learn to play soccer, riding a bike, drawing, gymnastics, (computer) games, anything). The group discussions of what to do, and how to select is a fun thing. It’s sort of how my kid discoverd that he liked to play the drums.</p>
<p>The 2nd way is to work from things in their environment, and get solving stuff. A friend of mine runs <a href="https://www.designathon.nl" rel="nofollow noopener">Designathon Works</a>, where they get kids to make imaginative solutions for big challenges in the world, like polution, traffic, jobs, violence, etc. Think of theme to adopt, and then organise a solution making event around it. Kids always think of things without the constraints that grown-ups put to it. Interesting things will come of it.</p>
<p>My only advice is not to call it peer learning. Like with grown-ups, kids won’t be convinced. “Lets learn a soccer trick”, now that’s appealing!</p>
