    <title>How sex workers learn professional skills</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/how-sex-workers-learn-professional-skills/407</link>
    <description>It&#39;s easy to dismiss being a sex worker as easy to figure out, but think about it for a second.  There&#39;s actually a lot to learn, not just bedroom techniques, but safety, client management, all aspects of the business, plus the huge range of related topics like physiology and therapy.

No secret that this is a huge industry, with practices ranging from slavery to government-supported safety monitoring.  But even in the most sanctioned and safe environments, the professional groups are somewhat underground.

So sex workers are a useful edge case to understand for peer to peer education. There&#39;s no University of Prostitution (I googled) but there&#39;s a huge industry and community that needs to, and does, learn.

As the title suggests [Britney Spears and the Mysteries of the Super Orgasm](https://primemind.com/britney-spears-and-the-mysteries-of-the-super-orgasm-c49e4062212c#.w2awo0a4h) might be a bit too much for some to read, but there are useful clues we can learn from:

On teaching each other techniques:
&gt; It’s not unusual for sex workers who team up to share a sexy, sororal bond that can include fondling and kissing, hand washing, spanking, pussy licking, and lots of caretaking.

And also a broader sense of purpose and community:
&gt; It’s also common for sex workers to adopt some version of a sex-worker-as-healer mentality for reasons of self-esteem, convenience, and entertainment. The idea that sex work can heal, sometimes called “sacred prostitution,” goes back as far as the 5th century BC to civilizations located in the modern day Middle East. 

And it seems there are blogs and magazines ranging from Playboy to [Dame](http://www.damemagazine.com/), from Cosmo to Scientific American, that verge into professionally-useful topics, and a now-defunct [magazine for sex workers](http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread). 

I imagine the economics of the magazine business were the cause of death, but that content must have moved online.

A bit more research in underground professions like this might lead us to some useful tools in peer to peer education.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Actually, I grew up in part of Vancouver that was known for prostitutes.  When I started a computer store as a teenager, I would deal with them using our back parking lot at night.  I used to chase them away so I didn’t have to clean up the parking lot in the morning. Later, when I went to university for early-morning classes, they’d be ending their shifts on my walk to the train and I got to know some of them.  We tend to see them in extremes - the drug-addicted street hooker or the glamourous-but-broken high-class prostitute - but I also saw a lot of self-empowered women with good business sense taking care of their families.  A common line of thinking was like you’d expect from a pro athlete: “I’ve got this body while I’m young so I’ll focus on this and make money so my family is set for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>And since then, a new (possibly majority) subcommunity of middle-class sex workers has emerged.  This looks more like girls who work part time to pay their way through university and self-supporting groups where the older women transition to more of a mentoring/safety role.  I remember asking one lady when I was 16, “Do you have a pimp?  Who protects you?”  She smiled and said, “Look around.  There are 5 girls that can see me now.  They’re my friends. We protect each other.  We know every customer. We know who’s with who and when they should be back.  We don’t need a pimp.”</p>
<p>So when I see things written about prostitution, I know there’s a lot more to it than what the media presents.  It’s a diverse community.</p>
