**The Royal Academy of Engineering** is the UK’s national academy for engineering and a registered charity, bringing together the most successful and talented engineers from across industries to advance and promote excellence in global engineering. Fellows of The Royal Academy of Engineering include design leaders James Dyson and Sir Ove Arup, radar pioneer Sir George MacFarlane, and Sir Maurice Wilkes, father of the UK computer industry.

The Academy is a formal partner of the UK Government’s Newton Fund, part of the UK’s official overseas development assistance (ODA), aiming to build international science and innovation partnerships that promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. 

**The [Leaders in Innovation Fellowships (LIF) programme](http://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-and-prizes/international-research-and-collaborations/newton-fund-programmes/leaders-in-innovation-fellowships):**
LIF builds partnerships with fellows and business leaders to develop their capacity for entrepreneurship and commercialisation of their research. The programme is aimed at engineers and researchers who are ready to commercialise their innovation, and will benefit from developing partnerships, mentoring, and networking in the UK. This year’s first cohort attending the programme in the UK welcomes participants from Colombia, Brazil and Chile for a focussed period of training in innovation and entrepreneurship.

**About the fellows:**
Meet, network, and mentor with leading engineering and research fellows, who developing sustainable and innovative solutions to some of the worlds most challenging problems! 

•	Previous participants of the LIF programme have worked on commercializing a wide variety of technologies, such as using lasers to etch nano-patterns into wind turbines to improve their performance.
Other LIF participants are focusing on ways to improve the livelihoods of people across emerging countries. For example,  making rice more nutritious andmaking it more economical to raise goats. 
•	Yet more are tackling some of the greatest issues facing society today, such as antibiotic-resistant bacteria and developing genomic technologies to boost agricultural yields – technologies and approaches aiming to save millions of lives in the future 

These technologies are aimed at everyone from rural farmers to businesses, from surgeons to city governments. Some fellows have raised hundred of thousands of dollars in funding while others are still proving concepts and conducting early tests.

**How to Participate:**
Meet, network, and develop business relationships through a series of training sessions and open events which Source Institute is running for LIF, including the [Source Summit Unconfenrence](http://www.sourcesummit.com/)), where we’re inviting interested members of the London tech community to learn, support and build relationships with the fellows.
