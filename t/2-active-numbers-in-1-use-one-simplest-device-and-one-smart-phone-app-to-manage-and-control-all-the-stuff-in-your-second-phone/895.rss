    <title>2 Active Numbers in 1 - Use one simplest device and one smart-phone app to manage and control all the stuff in your second phone</title>

    <description>Carrying two phones is not convenient! It is not fashionable or stylish; it costs a lot and is a waste of space. That&#39;s why we created PIECE!  PIECE is the future of Dual SIM technology. It is a tiny companion device that holds any GSM, EGSM, DCS, or PCS card, allowing you to add an extra number to your existing smart device via bluetooth. It is designed to fit in your wallet, front pocket, or behind your phone easily. PIECE is so small that it is only the size of a CREDIT CARD! That&#39;s why we like to call it &quot;The Next Small Thing&quot;
