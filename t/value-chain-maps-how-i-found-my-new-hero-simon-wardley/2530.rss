    <title>Value Chain Maps &amp; How I found my new Hero - Simon Wardley</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/value-chain-maps-how-i-found-my-new-hero-simon-wardley/2530</link>
    <description>First a bit about Simon.

&gt; Simon Wardley is a Researcher for CSC’s Leading Edge Forum, a global research and thought leadership community dedicated to helping large organizations become more successful by identifying and adopting Next Practices at the growing intersection between business and information technology. Simon’s focus is on the intersection of IT strategy and new technologies, and he currently leads our research entitled The Clash of the Titans.
&gt; 
&gt; Simon’s most recent published research (December 2014) is entitled Of Wonders and Disruption where he attempts to predict the nature of technological and business change over the next 20 years. His previous research covers topics including The Future is More Predictable Than You Think: A Workbook for Value Chain Mapping. Simon has also covered topics including Beware of Geeks Bearing Gifts: Strategies for an Increasingly Open Economy, Learning from Web 2.0 and A Lifecycle Approach to Cloud Computing.
&gt; 
&gt; Simon has spent the last 15 years defining future IT strategies for companies in the FMCG, Retail and IT industries. From Canon’s early leadership in the cloud computing space in 2005, to Ubuntu’s recent dominance as the No 1 Cloud operating system. 

He talks about how maps can be used in the logic of building a business. Moving logic to situational awareness first(Where? Why?), and action second(How? What? When?).

If you are interested in the concept, you can start reading more (chapter by chapter) [here](https://medium.com/wardleymaps).
