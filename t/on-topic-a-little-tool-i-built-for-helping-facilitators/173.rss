    <title>On Topic - a little tool I built for helping facilitators</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/on-topic-a-little-tool-i-built-for-helping-facilitators/173</link>
    <description>It&#39;s pretty simple.  Everyone sees the same screen, which shows the audience&#39;s wish on what to cover.  It&#39;s for moderated or self-moderated discussions, like fishbowls.

Here&#39;s a prototype I built a few months ago: http://topic-56643.onmodulus.net/

Like what&#39;s being said? Hit the heart.  The more people who hit it, the bigger it gets.
Missed something and want to go back? Hit rewind.
Bored and want to go forward? Hit forward. 

All the buttons reflect the number of clickers in the past few seconds. (These need to be calibrated for audience size.)

What do you think?</description>
