    <title>Facilitation skill: Visual Thinking</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/facilitation-skill-visual-thinking/155</link>
    <description>I mentioned [Visual Thinking School](http://xplaner.com/visual-thinking-school/) as [a good example of educational programme design](http://community.source.institute/t/the-if-then-helping-them-decide/151/2), but it deserves its own post for the content itself.

Visual communication skills are really a must-have for facilitators.  

Not just for use front-and-centre, but also because it&#39;s a skill we can easily teach so that people can teach each other. We did this back in the day in London.  Three founders were interviewed by the meetup using a fishbowl, and everyone took visual notes, which [we compiled](http://www.slideshare.net/foundercentric/lean-startup-london-august-2012) into what I call a **WeBook**.

They&#39;re also really useful to build the [craft](http://community.source.institute/t/building-communities-of-master-entrepreneurs/53/1) of facilitation, because visual communicators develop a broader sense of metaphor, and can make sense of complex concepts by mapping them spatially.

Visual Thinking School takes less than an hour, and is a fun thing to do from a cafe.  You just need a pen and paper, and your phone to watch the videos.

(By the way, Dave Gray&#39;s hitting the[ Lean Startup meetup](http://www.meetup.com/the-london-lean-startup-group/events/230000362/) in London in a few days.  Perfect chance to learn from the master.)</description>
