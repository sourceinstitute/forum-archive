    <description>does anyone know this company: https://andela.com/what-we-do/ ?

they are a VC funded outsourcing company for African developers
I think the story there is in the education and selection of talent. Seems they&#39;ve build some tech around that. Found them in the playfair capital portfolio.</description>

              <p>Andela is well known, over here in Nigeria. Perhaps because it was started here in Lagos, by it’s co-founder Iyin and Jeremy. Great job those guys are doing. They are currently taking only female fellows in the present batch.</p>
