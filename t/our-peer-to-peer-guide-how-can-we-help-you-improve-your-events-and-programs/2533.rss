    <title>Our Peer To Peer Guide - how can we help you improve your events and programs?</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/our-peer-to-peer-guide-how-can-we-help-you-improve-your-events-and-programs/2533</link>
    <description>Next week @bart and I are going to do a writing sprint to start off our _peer-to-peer education guide._    Our plan is to talk to different types of educators, community builders, event organisers to understand your current challenges, so what we produce is useful.

**If you&#39;re interested, please respond to this thread.**  We&#39;re already getting input from the likes of UCL, IMD, ESADE, Pirate Summit and others we admire. We&#39;d like to know what you&#39;re investing time in improving now, and how you think we might be useful. 


## How can this help you?

For education &amp; support programs:
- It doesn&#39;t make sense to plan content throughout the program for our scaling startups. Their needs are all different.
- My program content isn&#39;t tied to outcomes
- I want to help people adopt mindset or attitude
- I need to make my education program more relevant
- I want to flush out the most important topics
- Choosing the right weekly topics for an accelerator
- There are no available experts in the topics I want

For conferences and events:
- I want to create an environment that starts key relationships
- I need quality speakers for my conference
- I want conversations, but panels suck
- Too much hype, not enough substance
- Bad behaviour at my events - non-inclusive behavior / antagonism
- Grandstanding in talks or Q&amp;A

For community builders:
- I want to build on the strengths of a certain community
- I want to build certain capacity my local community 
- The key people in my community are leaving
- The key people in my community are hard to identify
- I need to take it on- or offline
- I want to build deeper relationships from amongst my community

Any other ways we could help?  We&#39;re all ears.

## Work plan

Next week, we&#39;ll start with a braindump from our last 8 years experience:
- over 100 unconferences run in 40 cities and 4 continents
- designing education programs for the world&#39;s top-tier and specialty accelerators (30+)
- building some of the world&#39;s biggest and most successful startup education programs (mostly white-labeled, but hey)
- being part of the evolution of various communities of practice, seeing them through different stages
- learning what works and doesn&#39;t in different cultures around the world
- being dropped into all kinds of hot frying pans

In spite of, and because of our experience, we have more questions than answers. So if writing out the first version is reasonably useful after the first week, we want to start interviewing people with different experiences in p2p edu - building out different topics in the guide with broader real-world experience.
