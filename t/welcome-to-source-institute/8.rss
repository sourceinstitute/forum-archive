    <title>Welcome to Source Institute</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/welcome-to-source-institute/8</link>
    <description>Entrepreneurs are - by our nature - learners.  We try new things, in new places. 

Tech entrepreneurs bring fast-changing technology to fast-changing markets. Traditional education can&#39;t always keep up. This is where peer-to-peer education is needed.  This is where Source Institute steps in.

The world is full of technology that helps humanity - humanitech.  From nanotech water filters in rural Tanzania to phone-mounted microscopes in Thailand, the success of these businesses helps society.  This is where we focus.

Here, you&#39;ll find:
* Our online courses, highlighting regionally-relevant challenges and taught be entrepreneurs who&#39;ve walked that path
* Discussions about our new initiatives - about what&#39;s really needed and how we can make a dent
* News about our projects, and how we can join forces

This forum is for everyone - not just entrepreneurs - who want to invest themselves towards bringing real technology to solve real needs, and use commerce as the vehicle to make sure it&#39;s sustainable.</description>
