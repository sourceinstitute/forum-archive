    <title>Getting Grants: Show Me How</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/getting-grants-show-me-how/27</link>
    <description>Matt is a former Deloitte consultant who started a business called Standard Microgrid to provide scalable power to rural Africa. They are among the first to have a high-amperage system able to bring industrial electric use to rural, off-grid areas.

They found they were spending around 9% of their time applying for grants and working with foundations to raise money - they raised $250,000 USD in 9 months from 3 grants.

We asked Matt to show us his system.

              <p>Yes, it is a story which starts from the experience first then going to use social media to look for organization which give grants. We too our Charity organization starts with research on rural areas to bring out rural orphans and then find sponsors. Our problem is we don’t get fund from sponsors after applying.<br>
Sometimes our experience is different because we just find addresses of donors and write to them asking for fund. This makes  us to fail running our or4ganization and getting low funds.</p>
<p>Our comments are that you help us how to raise fund to our NGO and help us to get donors to our NGO so that we may fullfill our foundation goals.<br>
Also we want to ask how can we apply for fund for our rural orphans for this year who have already started a school but there is no schoolfees and basic needs.<br>
