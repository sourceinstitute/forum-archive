          <p>How do you write a business plan? Should you write a business plan? What can you do once you‚Äôve written a business plan? Philip Walton and Matt Wainwright, two co-founders of successful African businesses, each found their own answers to these questions.</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Do</span> You Need a Business Plan?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äú20 years ago, you‚Äôd wite business plans - but they are vague. You would write hundreds of pages and talk about everything from the experience of your founding team to your market analysis and studies, you‚Äôd put all your data in there. It was a substantial piece of work. Here I learned that times have changed, investors are looking for different things. For me it was learning that investors are looking for something else‚Ä¶ Today it‚Äôs executive summary, a pitch deck and a set of financials.‚Äù<br>
-Philip Walton, Co-founder of BRCK</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Philip‚Äôs experience, you first seriously ask yourself if you need to write a business plan. If you don‚Äôt need one, why spend the time to create one? For example, Philip found that for his current business, it wasn‚Äôt really necessary. But, it might still be for you.</p>
<p>The real question is: who is your plan for? Are you writing it for yourself, for investors, or for another group? Think about what those audiences need and whether a business plan is the best way to go. But if you do write one, there are smart ways to do it.</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Business</span> Plan Writing Tips</p>
<p>Matt Wainwright found that many of the grants he wanted to apply to required him to have a business plan. First, that obviously told him that he needed a business plan. But how should he write it? He tailored his business plan to the kinds of grants he wanted to apply to. Each version was designed with an audience in mind.</p>
<p>First, that meant not going into too much detail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúA really good thing to do is develop a solid business plan. I‚Äôve written ours at a higher level point of view. It‚Äôs quite detailed but you can‚Äôt make it too long, you can‚Äôt capture every little aspect of your business. Typically, you have ten pages to say what it is, what it does. Acumen, actually, is a brilliant format which covers a whole lot of aspects because they‚Äôre looking for things broader than a typical business plan.‚Äù<br>
-Matt Wainwright, Co-founder of Standard Microgrid, Africa Prize shortlist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once he had his business plan, Matt would make small changes to make sure it was perfectly suited for whichever grant he was applying for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I found that a really really helpful format to use and I wrote our business around that. What I do when I‚Äôm applying for grants is I copy elements of the business plan into the relevant things for the grant. Or, once you‚Äôve filled in the details, you just submit that business plan.<br>
-Matt Wainwright, Co-founder of Standard Microgrid, Africa Prize shortlist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matt also adds research reports to his business plans to boost their credibility and make them a bit different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe other thing you can do to add validity to your kind of business plan is, use research reports. In the impact space, people spend a huge amount of money just building the knowledge base on what the problem is and what it looks like and doing research in these areas. It‚Äôs really really useful like this graph shows you how many people don‚Äôt have power in Sub Saharan Africa‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm using this IFC report to validate my data. You can pull in validation from really well written, well researched credible reports. It‚Äôs quite a helpful thing to do.‚Äù<br>
-Matt Wainwright, Co-founder of Standard Microgrid, Africa Prize shortlist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Matt includes information about the scalability of his business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs another thing you don‚Äôt typically see in a business plan. Is scalability. What aspects of your business leans itself to being scalable.‚Äù<br>
-Matt Wainwright, Co-founder of Standard Microgrid, Africa Prize shortlist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this all boils down to for both Matt and Philip is knowing why you‚Äôre making a business plan. They don‚Äôt make them just because they think they should. They write business plans only when there‚Äôs a reason to and constantly change the business plan to meet their exact needs.</p>
