    <title>When does video work for online education?</title>

&gt; Quality learning is happening without them, because we combine learning pathways, instructional scaffolding, interactive computing with our IPython Notebooks, and independent student work.

[Doing is learning.](http://community.source.institute/t/the-source-thesis/47)

And save video for what it&#39;s good for:

&gt; Institutions like the UK’s Open University have for decades been researching the best uses of video, including to show complex (or expensive, or dangerous) experiments; to illustrate ideas using slow-motion, fast camera or animation; to substitute for a field visit; and to demonstrate techniques or mechanical skills.

This is consistent with some [research published by EdX](http://pgbovine.net/publications/edX-MOOC-video-production-and-engagement_LAS-2014.pdf) ( consistent with the [Source Thesis](http://community.source.institute/t/the-source-thesis/47) ), challenging some teacher-centric ideas that just [moving teaching online](http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/03/10/pedagogical-roles-for-video-in-online-learning/) works: 

* Videos produced with a more personal feel could be more engaging than high-fidelity studio recordings.
* Khan-style tablet drawing tutorials are more engaging than PowerPoint slides or code screencasts.
* Even high quality pre-recorded classroom lectures are not as engaging when chopped up for a MOOC.
* Videos where instructors speak fairly fast and with high enthusiasm are more engaging.
* Students engage differently with lecture and tutorial videos</description>
