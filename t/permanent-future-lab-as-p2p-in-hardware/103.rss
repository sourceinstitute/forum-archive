    <title>Permanent Future Lab as P2P in hardware</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/permanent-future-lab-as-p2p-in-hardware/103</link>
    <description>In Utrecht I spent time in one of Seats2meet locations, and there I saw this concept. I think it is brilliant way how people can collaborate and explore. This is concept that is win win both for P2P community and for companies that support the lab with their products and have people test it out even before they go to market.

Permanent Future Lab excerpt:

&gt; Permanent Future Lab (PFLab) shares and facilitates accessibility to technology at publicly accessible locations. Anyone (such as animals, people and extraterrestrial life forms) of our society is welcome to (digitally) visit, discover and tinker with the available technology, without any monetary obligations! The only prerequisite as a visitor is to share experiences and other findings with others, resonating the entire eco-system PFLab thrives in: the sharing economy.
