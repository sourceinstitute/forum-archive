    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Source Camp One-pager](http://community.source.institute/t/source-camp-one-pager/230):

Hello everyone,

Happy to announce the definitive dates for Source Camp.

They’ll be from 6-8 June. We’ll stay at http://www.terreneuve.nl/ligging.html. It’s just a stone through from Velp station, one stop away from Arnhem station.

In terms of getting there by plane, a would suggest a booking to Schiphol, or from Dusseldorf (both are about equally far from Arnhem).

We are welcome to walk-in at noon on Monday 6th.

The program will be as follows:

Mon 6:
12.00 Walk-in/check-in
14.00 Kick-off with orientation and 360’s.
17.00 Mountain bike trekking in the forest (pending availability)
20.00 Dinner and other social activities at the house (Bart will make spaghetti)

Tue 7 (external day):
Full day unconference at the house
Dinner out, or catered (20/30 euro per person estimated)

Wed 8 (external day):
Morning and early afternoon fixer sessions.
Afternoon departure.

So far we have the following 10 people confirmed:
@boyana
@salim
@jansn 
@rvangeldrop
@robin
@ncerovac 
@lino
Vladi
@dan_toma 
@bart 

We might have 2-3 external people coming along who have change-maker positions with corporates.

Regarding the costs it will be **120 euro per person** for the whole stay for Source Fellows, including breakfast and lunch. 
Variable costs that come on top are tea/coffee/drinks during the day, dinner, and mountain biking. Let me know if you want to join the mountain biking, then I will make a reservation (also make sure you pack some clothes that can handle the mud :slight_smile:

I will arrange all the financials for this Source Camp. I&#39;ll make up the final cost break down after the Camp, and give you the payment details.

Let me know if you have any questions!</description>
