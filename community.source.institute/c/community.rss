              <p>Hackathons are volunteer-driven technology building gatherings usually between 30 to 200 strangers gathering around a certain technology or social problem. Teams form around project ideas, and build them in a day or so. It's a race against the clock to find an idea, make prototype and to demonstrate it at the end of the event. There's usually a judging panel who award a prize.</p>

              <p>What is education? We mostly associate it with systematic instruction. Showing and telling people how it’s done. But is that all there is to education? No. There’s also <a href="http://community.source.institute/t/if-you-can-get-kids-interested-in-math/84">a deeper part, that part of knowing why</a>, discovering what your reason is to appropriate these systematic handlings.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>The term "peers" is commonly used with reference to a group of learners of the same knowledge level and/or discipline. Doctors helping doctors.  Writers giving feedback to writers. This gives the impression that peer interaction is limited to where people with similar backgrounds connect (specific status, age, ability, qualification, etc.).</p>
