              <p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="https://community.source.institute/t/guide-360-feedback/99">Guide: 360 Feedback</a>:</p>
<p>The format for the 360 feedback as described above is great for evaluating each other on the level of a project that you’ve done together.  It gives you actionable recommendations, based on recently observed behaviour. It’s quick, fast, and fresh.</p>
<p>For an upcoming team gathering I was assessing what we could do to get a higher, more lateral overview for feedback, looking at the person, and our shared history with that person. It’s a longer feedback loop I was looking for.</p>
<h2>Questions to ask on a longer loop</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://lulucheng.quora.com/360-feedback-experiment?share=1&amp;srid=hOYE" rel="nofollow noopener">this post</a> which describes a setup where you ask people who are close to you, to answer a couple of reflective questions in writing (say over email) about yourself. The main idea to is spot patterns of consistency in the feedback you get from your respondents, which then implicitly turn into an actionable consideration.</p>
<p>Here are the questions (which I’ve adapted a bit, based on the learnings from the post I linked to above)</p>
<ol>
<li>What role does [your name] play in your life? (How do you know him/her)</li>
<li>What is [your name] good at? Describe her at his/her best.<br>
a. What are some ways you’d love to see him/her build on these strengths?</li>
<li>What is [your name] not so good at? Describe him/her on an off day.<br>
b. What are some ways [your name] can improve on her weaknesses?</li>
</ol>
<h2>The experiment</h2>
<p>I’m keen to try this on myself, and will be sending around requests for feedback within my team. I’ll report with a summary on how it went.</p>
<p>But, If you know me, and you feel confident about our relationship, then I grant you permission to email these questions to somebody we both know, who would be a great person to give me feedback on these questions. You’ll have my email address, naturally <img src="https://community.source.institute/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

              <p>What if we took the peer-to-peer education formats we’ve designed for our various projects, and opening them as a kit for others to plug in?</p>
<p>We’ve designed and run educational programs all over the world, in-person and online, and we have around 40-50 different activities and formats that we think can be helpful to others.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23leanstartupAMS&amp;src=tyah" rel="nofollow noopener">Lean Startup Summit</a>, we tested a few of the formats, plugging in an unconference with 3 specific Source formats that focused on relationship-building and practical knowledge.</p>
<p>Our view is to build a small subscription community that wants to make their conferences, accelerators, online courses and policy meetings more relevant regarding fast-changing subjects. We’re currently working with a few early-adopters, so if you’re interested, please get in touch with Salim by email:  salim -at-  source.institute</p>

<p>Source Institute is supporting the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Leaders of Innovation Fellowship (LIF) Program. In this programme we have fellows and innovators from 15 countries coming over to London for a 2 week residential entrepreneurship training.</p>
<p>As part of the LIF program, we want to offer the fellows the opportunity to venture out into London city when they have some time off, and experience its entrepreneurship vibe. This is where we would need your help</p>
<p>We’re looking for people who are familiar with Brazilian, Colombian, or Chilean culture, who can act as bridge to the UK, and show people around in the city. This would be a unique chance to network with some of the leading most innovative researchers from the respective countries.</p>
<p><strong>What we have lined up</strong><br>
Source has designed a set of experiences, which are both fun, and contain something educational, or provide a networking opportunity. We would ask you to support the fellows from the country you have an affiliation with, with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are 2 pub nights where you can have an informal check-in with your group. These would be on Tuesday 17th of Oct and the 25th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 19 Oct we have a networking meetup scheduled. You would support them to meet people, and get introduced to the UK technology innovation community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Sunday the 22nd, we’ve designed a set of uniquely London weekend activities. For instance, an option is to take your group to a 1930’s cinema, renovated into its original style, which was funded in a creative crowd funding campaign. This would be an opportunity to relax on a movie night, but also learn about crowdfunding. We would ask you to be available for that full day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, we invite you to join all the dinners we have scheduled during the LIF program, and other public events, but these wouldn’t be mandatory for you to join. Also we would ask you to be available on messenger (within the bounds of what’s reasonable, of course) to interact or give advice to fellows, should the ask for it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interested?</strong><br>
We area looking for people who would do this to help their fellow countryman. Additionally we’re covering all out of pocket expenses, tabs and will provide you with a   <strong>200 GBP compensation</strong> for your effort.</p>
<p>The group visiting in the October round for LIF are from Brazil, Colombia and Chile. If you have a great connection with one of these countries, and have lived/worked/studied in London for at least 6 months, then we’d love to hear from you!</p>
<p>To apply for this role, please contact <strong>niki@source.institute</strong></p>
<p>Here are some examples of weekend activities we might organise:</p>

<p><strong>The Royal Academy of Engineering</strong> is the UK’s national academy for engineering and a registered charity, bringing together the most successful and talented engineers from across industries to advance and promote excellence in global engineering. Fellows of The Royal Academy of Engineering include design leaders James Dyson and Sir Ove Arup, radar pioneer Sir George MacFarlane, and Sir Maurice Wilkes, father of the UK computer industry.</p>
<p>The Academy is a formal partner of the UK Government’s Newton Fund, part of the UK’s official overseas development assistance (ODA), aiming to build international science and innovation partnerships that promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-and-prizes/international-research-and-collaborations/newton-fund-programmes/leaders-in-innovation-fellowships" rel="nofollow noopener">Leaders in Innovation Fellowships (LIF) programme</a>:</strong><br>
LIF builds partnerships with fellows and business leaders to develop their capacity for entrepreneurship and commercialisation of their research. The programme is aimed at engineers and researchers who are ready to commercialise their innovation, and will benefit from developing partnerships, mentoring, and networking in the UK. This year’s first cohort attending the programme in the UK welcomes participants from Colombia, Brazil and Chile for a focussed period of training in innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>About the fellows:</strong><br>
Meet, network, and mentor with leading engineering and research fellows, who developing sustainable and innovative solutions to some of the worlds most challenging problems!</p>
<p>•	Previous participants of the LIF programme have worked on commercializing a wide variety of technologies, such as using lasers to etch nano-patterns into wind turbines to improve their performance.<br>
Other LIF participants are focusing on ways to improve the livelihoods of people across emerging countries. For example,  making rice more nutritious andmaking it more economical to raise goats.<br>
•	Yet more are tackling some of the greatest issues facing society today, such as antibiotic-resistant bacteria and developing genomic technologies to boost agricultural yields – technologies and approaches aiming to save millions of lives in the future</p>
<p>These technologies are aimed at everyone from rural farmers to businesses, from surgeons to city governments. Some fellows have raised hundred of thousands of dollars in funding while others are still proving concepts and conducting early tests.</p>
<p><strong>How to Participate:</strong><br>
Meet, network, and develop business relationships through a series of training sessions and open events which Source Institute is running for LIF, including the <a href="http://www.sourcesummit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Source Summit Unconfenrence</a>), where we’re inviting interested members of the London tech community to learn, support and build relationships with the fellows.</p>

              <p>The Royal Academy of Engineering’s Leaders in Innovation Fellowships (LIF) programme brings together dozens of researchers from around the world every year to train in capacity building and entrepreneurship. The idea is to equip them with the skills and networks to become technology entrepreneurs. This year’s final LIF cohort contains fellows from China, India, Colombia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>These fellows are working on commercializing a wide variety of technologies. For example, efficiency boosting turbines for everything from aircraft engines to wind farms. Several LIF fellows are examining ways to use technologies like lasers to etch nano-patterns into turbines to improve their performance.</p>
<p>Other emergent technologies being developed by LIF fellows focus on ways to improve the lives of millions of everyday people by, for example, making rice more nutritious, or making it more economical to raise goats. Yet more are targeting some of the greatest threats humans face today as a species, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, by developing a unique drug cocktail with the potential to save millions of lives in the future.</p>
<p>These technologies are aimed at everyone from rural farmers to defense contractors, surgeons to city governments. Some have raised hundred of thousands of dollars in funding while others are still proving concepts and conducting early tests.</p>

              <p>The Sources is an online course for African technology entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>It exists to empower entrepreneurs by exposing them to African founders who’ve walked the same path, and does so by sharing typically African challenges and appraoches, right from the source.  It started from an obvious gap in educational material for African markets,<br>
and has been encouraged by well-regarded communities like Techcabal and the<br>
Meltwater Entrepreneurial School Of Technology (MEST).</p>
<p>It develops and demonstrates well-known but underrated type of peer-education – storytelling – by bringing it online.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It creates higher-impact education by covering more relevant topics, and by delivering the education as it’s needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It filters out the most active and ambitious applicants from a high volume of students.</p>

              <h1>Source Camp</h1>
<h2>Want to learn about what it takes to create a startup communities and culture ?</h2>
<h3>Want to learn from the guys who brought Lean Startup to Europe? Want to hear how the groundwork was laid for startup communities in London? Want to know how local heroes became global thought-leaders?</h3>
<h2>Source Camp</h2>
<p>Source Camp is a 3-day internal knowledge-sharing event at which members of Source Institute teach each other their latest educational and community-building techniques, and share the latest trends.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eight months ago, Source Institute formed out of a pre-existing group of Community Builders,  Growth Hackers, Hardware Investors, Creative Entrepreneurs, Educators , Institutional Investors and Internet Entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Our prior work has been at the heart of building Europe’s startup communities. We brought Lean Startup to Europe in 2009, and spent years connected it to Europe’s strengths, like business model design and user experience design. (These disciplines became part of startup vocabulary around the world because of our community in London.) We designed and delivered startup education programmes for most of the accelerator industry in its first few years, and went on do the same for universities like Oxford, UCL and Imperial.</p>
<p>Since then, things have moved fast.  We’ve designed and developed 2 state-fo-the-art startup education programmes, the Africa Prize, and Leaders In Innovation Fellowship, started a university research consortium on the effectiveness of different forms of entrepreneurship education, released a researched book on effective startup mentoring, and have partnered with a world-wide student organisation to deploy a one-day practicum in starting up which will be deployed to 35,000 new entrepreneurs in 100 countries.  Source Institute is emerging as leaders in peer to peer education.</p>
<h2>The Opportunity</h2>
<p>Source Camp is coming to the sunny meadows of Netherlands. But this time we hold a special opportunity for selected people to join us.</p>
<h2>Learn About:</h2>
<p><strong>Intrapreneurship</strong> - How to foster innovation and change from within a company to an extent which a consultant can’t.<br>
<strong>Community Building</strong> - How to rally a community at a city or organisational level, and leverage its strengths to position that community as a global leader<br>
<strong>Mentor Impact</strong> - A study on what innovation mentoring techniques lead to success<br>
<strong>Decision Hacks</strong> -  A study in how successful founders make good decisions fast.<br>
<strong>Peer Education</strong> - How to create relevant and immediate education in fast-changing environments<br>
<strong>Your Topic</strong> - Have a problem or an idea you want feedback on ? This is your chance.</p>
<h2>Apply to Source Camp</h2>
<p>This is a 2-day event, with a maximum of 15 people.</p>
<p>Day 1 (June 7) - <em>Unconference</em>.   Participants choose the topics, and we run up to 15 one-hour sessions in 3 parallel tracks.  You’ll learn a range of new techniques from the source.</p>
<p>Day 2 (June 8)- <em>Fixers</em> - Participants bring their challenges to each other, and we roll up our sleeves to solve them. You’ll learn how those with complimentary strengths to you think through your challenges and find actionable advice.</p>
<p>There is also time for nature walks and fireside chats.</p>
<h2>To apply</h2>
<p>This is an invitation-only event, so please contact us at hello@source.institute</p>
<p>External rate: 1000 EUR<br>
Source Institute Fellows: 200 EUR</p>

          <title>Startup Deep Dive - a structured first step in becoming a founder</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[@salim Salim Virani]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Projects</category>

            <blockquote>
              <p>What do you do when you’re considering being an entrepreneur?</p>
<p>There are a few events that can help.  Startup Weekend, Lean Startup Machine. Those events are designed around launching a startup more than skills building, and the quality of each event really depends on the local organiser and mentors.</p>
<p>In 2016, we think that a new approach is needed.  Something community run, and designed around the growth of founders, rather than the progress of startup ideas.  Deep Dive is a one-day event where you learn to launch, focusing on the skills you need and creating an experience that empowers <em>every</em> participant, helping them decide if being a founder is right for them and if it is, giving them the skills, support and momentum to take the next steps.</p>
<h1>The opportunity</h1>
<p>We’re working with AIESEC, a global student organisation, spanning 120 countries and covering 60,000 students per year.  Their goal is develop world citizens with leadership skills.   This means Deep Dive will be run globally, including strong presences in countries where startups aren’t common.</p>
<h1>The challenge</h1>
<p>To design a programme that enables everyone to be a founder, but is facilitated by non-entrepreneurs.  We’ve seen horribly failed attempts at taking workshop material designed to be taught by entrepreneurs and handing it over to inexperienced students to teach.  So many accelerators and innovation consultancies fail because they’ve taken this approach. A ground-up redesign is in order.</p>
<p>Plus, the global footprint of this programme also means that what’s taught must be relevant to that region, even though local business mentors may not available.</p>
<h1>What we’re doing with AIESEC</h1>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Design</span><br>
We’re investing heavily in a new programme design and new forms of interactive education.</p>
<p>Deep Dive is being designed based on learnable facilitation skills, and modules that can regionalise easily. Entrepreneurial expertise is injected using relevance-and-recall techniques we’ve developed for our online video course, The Sources.</p>
<h1>Train The Trainer</h1>
<p>The programme is designed to be self-propagating - so the students can quickly become the teacher.  We’re deploying this programme worldwide, training students to be entrepreneurs with Deep Dive, then supporting them to launch their own businesses within days.  This gives them the experience necessary to turn around and teach the next batch coming in behind them.</p>

              <p>Oxford is one of the world’s most revered universities, with world-leading schools in economics and social enterprise.</p>
<h1>The challenge</h1>
<p>Oxford Career Services wanted students to make informed career decisions, especially given that large companies invest heavily in recruiting Oxford grads.  We were invited to design a weekend programme that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gave students a realistic sense of being an entrepreneurs</li>
<li>Gave students skills that were both useful as entrepreneurs, and on the job market</li>
</ol>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Design</span> &amp; Delivery<br>
We designed a programme to be delivered by Source-selected entrepreneurs.  It emulated much of the strife of being an entrepreneur while layering on key skills in early-stage technology entrepreneurship. The workshops oscillated from story-telling to application, with teams of students progressing with their business idea.  We’ve run this programme every semester for over 2 years.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Immersion achieved 3 important outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s exciting and engaging to students, and with little promotion is well-attending, even during busy times of year.</li>
<li>Roughly 10% of attendees actually launch the business they started in Immersion. Others go on to found new companies and still more use their skills to get jobs in startups.</li>
<li>Most importantly, students leave the weekend feeling they’re now in a position to decide for themselves with an important choice: do I go down the startup path?</li>
</ol>

<p>Its fellows include design leaders James Dyson and Sir Ove Arup, radar pioneer Sir George MacFarlane, and Sir Maurice Wilkes, father of the UK computer industry.</p>
<p>The Leaders In Innovation Fellowship is a pinnacle programme under The Newton Fund, bringing over 200 leading engineers from 15 countries to the UK to support them in commercialising their innovations.</p>

<h1>What we did with The Royal Academy Of Engineering</h1>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Design</span><br>
Taking a lead on programme design, we shifted the programme from pre-determined workshops run for each country in isolation, to one where the engineers dictated their learning goals and could learn from each other.</p>
<p>The programme overlapped various country visits, the workshops were redesigned to allow for greater peer-learning, and we added peer-to-peer conferences to allow for these highly-accomplished engineers and entrepreneurs to teach each other.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Peer-Support</span> And Training<br>
To ensure a high bar for participants, we developed a set of experiential workshops which could quickly bring less experienced engineers to an innate understanding of topics like customer interviews, fund-raising and team formation.</p>
<p>We curated and facilitated a number of multi-track peer-conferences, which became the highlight of the entire programme for many of the participants, particularly those who were active entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Our peer-conferences are now being used as the primary way for alumni in each region to support each other.</p>

          <title>How Source builds communities</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[@bart Bart Doorneweert]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Source Activities</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><a href="https://community.source.institute/u/bart">@bart</a> wrote:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>It’s hard to engineer the happening of a community. It’s more like a process of bringing together the right compounds at the right moment in time, and experimenting with different combinations to invoke or catalyse a reaction. Much more like chemistry actually, than engineering.</p>
<p>In this brief we’ll outline some of the compounds we have available through <a href="http://source.institute">Source Institute</a> to create that community chemistry. We’ll explain this, starting from a higher-order perspective on the startup ecosystem, and move down to the lower order facets of entrepreneurship communities, teams, people, and skills.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Ecosystem</span><br>
So, starting at the highest level, it’s important to come to grasps with the global overview of the landscape in which we want to build a community. We need to understand what founders are out there, already working on projects relevant to the community. How did they do it? Where did they succeed? Where do they typically get stuck on? What can they teach others? <a href="http://thesources.co/a/">The Sources</a> is an online education platform for founders in Africa, and is an example of one of the forms of getting these insights out there.</p>
<p>This scan of the current system is vitally important. It flushes up the signposts that need to be placed for acceleration. Our philosophy at Source is to design systems of acceleration around removing barriers at relevant times, and providing for relevant connections, whether it’s through knowledge or people. Our <a href="http://guides.co/guide/the-accelerator-design-guide">accelerator design guide</a> shows more about how we approach this.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Local</span> strengths<br>
The most important thing to understand about a local ecosystem is what the local strengths are. We can’t model everything on what works for Silicon Valley, we need to find our own approach, and work with measures of success that fit to our specific goals.</p>
<p>Part of finding local strengths comes from understanding the experience of founders, as is done in mapping the ecosystem. But another part is to find what kind of support other companies and organisations can give, which are relevant to founders. For instance in our work for <a href="https://foundry.unilever.com">Unilever Foundry</a>, we designed support input for founders, based on the marketing strengths that are available within the Unilever company.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the aspect of connecting and exchanging strengths between various communities. Like a good trade system, it makes more sense to leverage each other’s comparative advantage, than to only focus on your own competitiveness vis-a-vis others.</p>
<p>The same goes for connecting entrepreneurship ecosystems. Through a format like Source Summits, we work on building these bridges. Recently we’ve hosted a <a href="http://sourcesummit.com">Source Summit in East Africa</a> to connect fragmented country systems, and entrepreneurial skills. In the near future we’ll be setting up new <a href="//community.source.institute/t/network-to-bring-academic-integrity-to-entrepreneurship-education/87">Source Summits with 5 universities in the EU</a> to build a network of academic scrutiny on entrepreneurship education. All these events are opportunities to get together relevant pockets of knowledge, and of entrepreneurial strengths and skills, and figure out how to connect them. Source Summits get resources flowing through the system.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Shaping</span> community leaders<br>
At Source we use various peer learning formats to help build the characters that are needed to propel communities. Through our <a href="http://mentorimpact.co">Mentor Impact</a> approach, we help mentors define their role and approach to helping founders, and share amongst their peers what works in the community, and what doesn’t. This is self-propagating by design. Once there’s a first group of peers set up to exchange, they will loop in others.</p>
<p>Another kind of support we provide is to gear experienced founders to become facilitators to talent that have valuable knowledge to share. Facilitation addresses both the facets of warranting learning for the learners, as well as supporting that knowledge is brought out there effectively. Through our facilitation support we help people manage group learning dynamics, spot where support is needed, and take action on bringing that in. In other words, it makes support to founders responsive.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can help distribute leadership over communities, distributed over the founders who have the responsibility over their progress. A concept like <a href="//community.source.institute/t/braintrust-peer-advisory-groups/198/1">Brain Trust</a> is a tool created to support that dynamic. Essentially Brain Trust is a structure where founders share their learning, their current blocks, and what they think their learning goals are. This enables other founders to see and learn, as well as provide advice on how to tackle blocks, and at the same time learn from their peers. For the facilitator, it provides a check-in on progress of a group.</p>
<p>All our effort in building leadership, goes into the ambition to make a community self-propagating, to shape its own purpose and destiny. Our long term aim as Source is to become part of the community, to learn from it, and to grow as it grows…</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Experiential</span> learning<br>
Source builds essential entrepreneurship skills, based on our collaborations with the cutting edge of experience that we see in our network. Our thinking is visible in startup education around the world, whether it’s our collaborations with thought leaders like Eric Ries and Alex Osterwalder, or techniques like The Mom Test, Option Cards and Brain Trust which are copied in training material around the world.</p>
<p>The common thread is our design for cognition of entrepreneurship experiences, rather than for cognition of content. We look for ways to address the “why”, and “how” around key topic areas for entrepreneurs, based on our own experiences, and what we learn from others first hand.</p>
<p>Our selection of experiential learnings range from team alignment, to investment, to figuring out mass production for your hardware startup.</p>
<p>#<a href="//community.source.institute/t/the-source-thesis/47">The Source Thesis</a><br>
The biggest part of creating entrepreneurship communities hinges on how knowledge is created and shared amongst people within that community. Current pedagogical approaches are not adequate to cater to the kind of dynamic that is required.</p>
<p>At Source Institute we see that peer learning is the missing fabric. We aim to create the new social structures that will accelerate technology entrepreneurship, and strengthen it as a force to address the world’s challenges. We hope to meet you in this ambition, and that our relationship may become one of the conduits in a system of entrepreneurial learning.</p>

Its fellows include design leaders James Dyson and Sir Ove Arup, radar pioneer Sir George MacFarlane, and Sir Maurice Wilkes, father of the UK computer industry.</p>
<p>The Africa Prize marked a shift from UK-centered support to on-the-ground support across Sub-Saharan Africa.  Source Institiute worked with the Royal Academy, delivering the entire program.</p>
<p>By the second year, we were supporting our innovators to acheive 2-3X growth, addressing multiple national markets and getting international recognition from the likes of the BBC World Service.</p>

<h1>The challenge</h1>
<p>Design and deliver a full 6-month training programme, to address the needs of 15 early-stage engineering startups in a range of markets, stages and technologies.</p>
<p>How can we design and deliver a programme that helps African engineers launch in African markets, founder mindset, marketing channels, funding options and research methods all needed to <strong>be addressed on local terms</strong>?</p>

<h1>What we do with The Royal Academy Of Engineering</h1>
<p>For 3 years, since the start, we’ve delivered all entrepreneur-support aspects of the Africa Prize. Only selection, judging and PR fall outside of our responsibility. Each year, we support 15 African entrepreneurs, aiming to create an inflection point in their growth.</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Design</span><br>
We blend principles from internet startups and African tech companies, creating new workshops with Africa-specific perspectives on product design and business models.  The program covers business fundamentals from an African tech perspective, and highly-targeted peer-support and peer-education components, which are augmented by including mentors and role models with relevant go-to-market experience.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Peer-Support</span> And Training<br>
Our best trainers and facilitators from Europe and Africa deliver two intensive weeks of training in Ghana, South Africa and Kenya, connected by ongoing remote support.  This training included experiential workshops but emphasised facilitated peer-support, allowing the strengths of each entrepreneur on the shortlist to help others.</p>
<h1>Community-Building</h1>
<p>These were combined with community events, and Source-run uhttp://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-and-prizes/international-research-and-collaborations/africa-prizenconferences, to draw in support and build relationships. The programme connects our startups to the heart of African startup ecosystems through regional leaders like MEST and iHub.</p>
<h1>Learn more</h1>
<p>Source Institute has delivered the full Africa Prize support and education programme since it’s launch in 2014, and continues to deliver and improve upon it.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>This is a guide on how to run a 360 feedback in Source, and why we do it.</p>
<h1>Aim:</h1>
<p>"Knowing is half the battle"<br>
<em>G.I. Joe</em></p>
<p>The main aim is to gain awareness about your behaviour and how it affects  the people around you - positively or negatively. It gives you more complete information in the inter-team dynamics and and insight what to get better at.<br>
This particular format creates a safe and easy environment to address minor or major problems that were not addressed previously for some reason. By resolving those problems on time, you decrease stress and increase productivity. By sharing the positives you find which is the right path and everyone can enjoy their work while growing the organization successfully.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Rules of Thumb:</h1>
<h2>When is it appropriate to do a 360?</h2>
<ul>
<li>when you feel you need one (you don’t need to be the project lead to call for a 360)</li>
<li>especially after big projects - can be a good addition to a Retrospective</li>
<li>most companies make it once a year, but from our experience, for smaller and fast moving organizations it’s good to have one every couple of months.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cover everything in terms of your work together - not only personality traits of your team mate, but also about way of communications or dynamics when working together or the methodologies, organizational design or tools</li>
<li>No need to be the whole team - can do  few iterations of smaller groups of people - especially when it’s a remote team.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles:</h2>
<p>The 360 FB needs one facilitator. The same person can also receive FB in the session.<br>
Functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping time</li>
<li>keep the conversations within the format. Not let conversations derail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Timing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared to spend most of the day with those people, don’t set any other appointments</li>
<li>For the feedback session itself a good rule of thumb is 2 hour for 4 people team. For every additional person add another at least 30 min (growing exponentially).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>The format itself:</h1>
<h2>Session rules (you can make visuals of the rules and stick them on the wall)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full attention (no phones)</li>
<li>Flow of communication - If you’re the one getting feedback, you just listen and reflect. All you can do is ask for clarification if you haven’t understood something</li>
<li>Listen! - it’s important to understand their point of view, without defending why it happened.</li>
<li>You Decide - in the end of the day you decide what to do with the feedback. If you get the same input from more and one person, it’s good to think about that behaviour. If you get FB from just one person but think this is important for the dynamic between you two, you can just adjust your behaviour towards that person.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>When giving feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be specific - give examples of when this happened - tell the story shortly
<ul>
<li>BIO - a useful method for giving negative feedback constructively is to state the:
<ul>
<li>Behaviour the person had (and the occasion)</li>
<li>Impact it had on you and your feelings</li>
<li>Outcome the whole situation produced</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep it actionable - suggest how the person can improve</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>and Deltas - aim for 2 of each
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>is what you want to see more of</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delta is what you’d like to see changed (improved)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Others will agree”/ “A. said he felt bad when you…”- Talk about the impact on you, the others will address their problem when it’s their turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When receiving feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recap what others said, to make sure you understand it</li>
<li>Ask questions if you’re not sure you’ve understood</li>
<li>Don’t comment or respond. Try to understand the other person’s side and understand the impact on them</li>
<li>Say what actions you want to take (even if it is “I need a meeting to root-cause this in a retro, I’m taking it on, but we need to go in details before I can take actions”)</li>
<li>Ask for help - If you don’t know how to improve, you can always ask for help from others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sharpies</li>
<li>Plain cards</li>
<li>sticky notes with rules, tips and timing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flow of the day:</h2>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p>It doesn’t need to be rushed. As a start can give yourself some time to hang out and let yourself feel comfortable emotionally.</p>
<h3>The session</h3>
<ol>
<li>5-10 min - Briefing about the format - Even when the organisation is used to the format, just do a quick reminder and stick it on the wall for people to see.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Aim of the format</li>
<li>Rules</li>
<li>Tips</li>
<li>Structure and timing<br>
<em>Especially if you do 360 feedback for the first time, it’s important to create a trusting and open environment - nobody is perfect and nobody is here to blame the others. We all want to gain a better understanding of how we impact each other in the team. As facilitator, keep this attitude and remind people if they derail.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Decide on a person to give feedback to</li>
<li>3-5 min- Write down feedback (1 idea per card) - 3-5 min</li>
<li>5 min - Each team mate walks through their cards and explains</li>
<li>5 min - The person receiving feedback can ask questions, recap what they understood and share ideas for next steps to be taken.</li>
<li>Continue with the person seating next and repeat points 3. to 5. until everybody has received feedback.</li>
<li>15 min people reflecting on their feedback (optional, but usually it naturally continues into further discussions.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>After the session</h3>
<p>You can ask if anyone wants do add or ask anything. Then let the conversations continue naturally - to some ideas you have for change/ to helping someone with a particular problem or just friendly conversations</p>
<h3>Have fun!</h3>
<p>It’s important to do something fun together and not just leave - either go for lunch/ beers/ bowling/ hiking/ something else fun.</p>

          <title>Network to bring academic integrity to entrepreneurship education</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[@bart Bart Doorneweert]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Projects</category>
          <description><![CDATA[

            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>The Opportunity</strong><br>
To build a continuous network for exchange of learnings, peer reviewed research, and the latest about entrepreneurship education, including P2P methods.</p>
<p><strong>Common Goal - how will it make a difference?</strong><br>
The current Erasmus network exists of educators, who all see that we need to step our game on entrepreneurship education. The questions we’ll be addressing through this current starting phase of the network, is how to effectively design P2P learning mechanisms into entrepreneurship education.</p>
<p><strong>Organisation Goals:</strong><br>
<strong>Wageningen University</strong> is known for cross disciplinary research in food and agriculture. It already addresses entrepreneurship in some of its course, but the idea is to further the topic through all of the university courses. Entrepreneurship is not yet part of the culture in food and agriculture. This has to built in through education.</p>
<p><strong>University of Copenhagen</strong> has been ramping up university teachers’ skills to become better at entrepreneurship education. The university is also actively picking up its role in entrepreneurship ecosystem development.</p>
<p><strong>University of Tartu</strong> is actively pursuing entrepreneurship education, and making courses in their curricula. They want to build on this dynamic with new insights on education.</p>
<p><strong>University of Lisbo</strong>n has very little experience with entrepreneurship education. But the faculty of Human Kinetics is actively looking for ways of involving its students entrepreneurship, to figure out how it can be integrated into the field of sports, and rehabilitation.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Educators UK</strong> aims to promote enterprise education within every university in the UK, regardless of the business orientation of the course or not. They have a stack of approaches available that they want to bring into this network for experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>Source Institute</strong> is developing the forefront of P2P education, and has leeway to try and test the latest in techniques before it is a thing. We are here to feed the network with new insights, and learn about how to look out for efficacy of P2P education techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic relevance:</strong><br>
This is an opportunity to build a P2P network around P2P EntEd. We have the opportunity to build a body of authority in the education community through this network, we help define what’s important to measure as outcomes. Our competitors can either choose to join it, or build their own.</p>
<p><strong>Budget:</strong><br>
Euro 90k</p>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong><br>
36 months, starting from July 2016.</p>
<p><strong>People needed:</strong><br>
Sal and Bart for helping feed the network with tools and edcuation experiences on P2P<br>
Other Source Fellows can be included for either of the 5 Source Summits that will be held during the course of this project.</p>
<p><strong>Resources needed:</strong><br>
For Source, this is an investment project. We’re only getting some compensation for our time and effort. We’ll ask for Source Fellow’s support on a voluntary basis, and arrange for compensation if that is possible. The return will lie in meeting the entrepreneurship network in 5 european cities, and in being part of network that sets the tone for entrepreneurship education to come.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>proven-effective P2P methods</li>
<li>spread of the Source brand in the right way, through the 5 Summits that will be held in this project</li>
<li>recognition from our new, and existing client/partners of our involvement in this network</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>To keep the consortium focused on key challenge areas in the broader EntEd industry, we’ll run several research cycles per year, each of which will start by convening key actors in EntEd to share their challenges and approaches. This will help us choose both success measures, educational methods to test, and expose context to help define experiements.  Experiments will be designed, run and analysed by participating universities, and the impact of our efforts will be shared at the beginning of the following cycle. This iterative approach will help keep us relevant, and keep the scope of our efforts as a consortium manageable, improving our approach as we go.</p>
<p>Source’s core contribution to this project consists of 2 points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Participating in the consortium meeting, where the relevant new experiments on P2P learning approaches are discussed, and decided.</li>
<li>Organise Source Summits around this meeting, to pull in the voices from the local entrepreneurial community, where the meeting will be held. The project results will be promoted through the Source Summit website.</li>
</ol>
<p>The universities involved will take the lead in implementing the experiments, analysing results, and learning from them. Also universities will support us to organise the Summits, and identify &amp; attract the various voices from the local ecosystem.</p>

              <p><a href="http://source.institute">Source Institute</a> is objective-driven. We work actively to develop better, more relevant education methods – and focus on projects that we believe will have the highest impact.</p>
<p>Working with us is simple.   The best way is to take a look at<a href="//community.source.institute/c/activities/concepts"> the new programmes we’re designing</a>, and talk to us if one of them aligns with your goals. You can also let us know about your goals. Our first engagements are often done by commissioning us for a few days, on a flat-fee.</p>
<p>What we’re really aiming for, though, are open, transparent partnering relationships where we establish common goals, constraints and resources, and apply our most innovative thinking towards them.</p>
<p>These relationships mean that we work within a budget towards measurable objectives, and can use the most effective tools in our tool-belt.  Our partners pick up the most innovative startup education techniques, enjoy transparency over our costs, with rates that decrease with volume.</p>
<p>You can also get in touch via email: <a href="http://mailto:hello@source.institute">hello@source.institute</a>.</p>
