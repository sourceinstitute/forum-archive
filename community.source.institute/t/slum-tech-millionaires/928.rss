    <title>Slum tech millionaires</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/slum-tech-millionaires/928</link>
    <description>Had some interesting ideas with Octopizzo about teaching Kiberans to launch tech businesses. Africans watch Kenyans and raising the profile of a few early successes could trigger a tipping point. P2p ed could enable a wave. Particularly [self-propagating](http://community.source.institute/t/self-propagating-workshops/204) ed like [village accelerator](http://villageaccelerator.com).

Now there&#39;s an ISP in Kibera. If adoption picks up, I&#39;d like to get on it. 

&gt; At the beginning of September poa! Internet began to ramp up its sales and marketing activity. It now offers access all over Kibera with 55 access points with Wi-Fi hot-spots. If slums could be celebrities then Kibera is Kenya’s celebrity slum. This city within a city has – with some nearby rural edge of city areas – a population of 3.1 million
