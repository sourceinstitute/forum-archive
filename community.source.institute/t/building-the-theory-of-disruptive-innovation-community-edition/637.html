          <p>Many have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation">theory of disruptive innovation</a>. A theory built on a unique complete data set of the market for hard disks in the United States, covering a decade or two. This theory held a lot of explanatory capacity for the role of innovation in competition, growth of companies, as well as limits to their growth.</p>
<p>The theory has enjoyed fame and fortune, and has been adopted by many management thinkers and practitioners. But in the last couple of years, it’s had some <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/the-disruption-machine">push-back from academics in other fields</a>, and a blowout from by the theory’s inventor, Clayton Christensen, trying to sort things by writing an article attempting to explain just <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation">what is disruptive innovation</a>. In all, this has been a sad sequence of events in this discourse, on what is still a relevant theory with relevance to the daily life of a business.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Making</span> it open, makes it better<br>
But now things are on the change for the better I feel. Christensen has decided to flip the game of theory building, by moving from the ivory tower, to the community. He’s set up a forum called <a href="http://disruptiveinnovation.org">Disruptiveinnovation.org</a>.</p>
<p>The forum invites discussion on the various parts of the foundations of disruptive innovation. More interestingly, they’re applying <a href="http://disruptiveinnovation.org/theorybuilding/building-process">a process of gradual quality improvement</a> to the process of building a better theory for disruptive innovation (yes, you are reading this correctly: a lean process for theory building).</p>
<p>The forum is still empty at the moment; it just launched. But I’ll be following it’s progress. I’m expecting it to feature some great learning opportunities on the future of theory building, and education on entrepreneurship, and innovation.</p>
