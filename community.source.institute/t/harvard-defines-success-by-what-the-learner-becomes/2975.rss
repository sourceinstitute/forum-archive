<p>What is the process of education? Some people will say transmission of knowledge. But I can only transmit information. Knowledge is something that needs to be constructed in the heads of the students.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The true hallmark of understanding is to be able to transfer your knowledge to a new context.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I totally agree with this. There is a big difference between learning, knowledge and understanding. Without understanding, individuals cannot apply knowledge into new scenarios, and thus something new (innovation) cannot be created with what was learnt.</p>
<p>I have seen this in open-source communities, where individuals learn but feel they cannot work in real-world scenarios or companies.</p>
<p>Their ability to work in companies comes when they apply that knowledge through discussions or practice. It is really a beautiful thing to watch.</p>
