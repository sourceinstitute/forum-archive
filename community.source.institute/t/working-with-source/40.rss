    <description>[Source Institute](http://source.institute) is objective-driven. We work actively to develop better, more relevant education methods -- and focus on projects that we believe will have the highest impact.

Working with us is simple.   The best way is to take a look at[ the new programmes we&#39;re designing](http://community.source.institute/c/activities/concepts), and talk to us if one of them aligns with your goals. You can also let us know about your goals. Our first engagements are often done by commissioning us for a few days, on a flat-fee.

What we&#39;re really aiming for, though, are open, transparent partnering relationships where we establish common goals, constraints and resources, and apply our most innovative thinking towards them.  

These relationships mean that we work within a budget towards measurable objectives, and can use the most effective tools in our tool-belt.  Our partners pick up the most innovative startup education techniques, enjoy transparency over our costs, with rates that decrease with volume.

You can also get in touch via email: [hello@source.institute](http://mailto:hello@source.institute).</description>
