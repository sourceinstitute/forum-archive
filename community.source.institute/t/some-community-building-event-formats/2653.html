          <p>I just wanted to share a few ideas I had for P2P learning events at <a href="http://thehouse.social">The House</a>, a new club in Sofia for people who are passionate about what they do.  I’m going to propose them as some fun side projects.</p>
<h1>Instrumental</h1>
<p>Learn the behind the scenes of different crafts and jobs.</p>
<p>Dinners for 5+ where everyone presents their favourite tool of their trade, and then makes dinner together.  The dinners will be made in kits by <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294452-d10797662-Reviews-Daro-Sofia_Sofia_Region.html">Daro</a> with instructions for everyone to follow, and one hard dish that gives everyone a sense of how difficult cooking can be.</p>
<h1>Hyperspective</h1>
<p>Expand your worldview.</p>
<p>Meetup that  starts with 5 people each making a 2 minute presentation on something interesting from outside of their main area of expertise, that expanded their worldview.</p>
<h1>Reframe</h1>
<p>Someone suggests a movie and gives a 2-5 minute presentation with screenshots, deconstructing the film as they choose.  Could be from the art and techniques of film-making, the story line and symbolism, or just what parts you liked and what the film means to you.</p>
<p>After the short presentation, we watch the film then have a drink together.</p>
<h1>Head-scratchers</h1>
<p>Someone presents a problem or challenge they’re facing, followed by a fishbowl Q&amp;A.  Then mingling over drinks while anyone with ideas comes to the front and contributes to an post up board with ideas, suggestions and references.</p>
<h1>Young blood</h1>
<p>Drinks night where each member is allowed to invite only one non-member who they believe is a future success, and pays for their ticket. Young bloods are given<a href="../ice-breaker-missions-game/2601.html">silly tasks</a>.</p>
<h1>Peer-mentoring day</h1>
<p>A place to come to get serious help with your current business challenges.</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone has 30 seconds to introduce themselves and the kind of help they need.</li>
<li>Then another round of intros again, this time 60 seconds on how they can help the challenges they’ve heard.</li>
<li>Short presentation on mentoring styles, and each person selects the style of mentoring they need for their challenge: advice, sounding board, see someone do it, try it together, brainstorm… (based on the <a href="http://mentorimpact.com">mentorimpact.com</a> research)</li>
<li>45 minutes of mingling where everyone seeks out the mentors or mentees they see as relevant, quickly assesses to see if they should set appointments with each other,</li>
<li>3 mentoring appointments that are 45 minutes each.</li>
</ol>
