[Inge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inge_Druckrey) is a thought-leader in design, and covers some nice approaches to education in this documentary (made by Edward Tufte).

She defines a good lesson as **a set of experiences with a goal**.

[Craft](http://community.source.institute/t/building-communities-of-master-entrepreneurs/53) is strongly emphasised, and she layers on different skills, from training your eye to machining your own printing plates.  With calligraphy, it&#39;s copy and correct. Use rhythm to build muscle memory, then make it your own.

I like how she associates body parts to learning styles:

&gt; Eyes are conservative. They want structure and order
&gt; Hands are radical.  They want to go faster and be expressive.</description>
