    <description>A few posts that&#39;ll get you thinking about the control you have on the quality of your time:

[Maker&#39;s Schedule, Manager&#39;s Schedule, by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

&gt; Most powerful people are on the manager&#39;s schedule.  It&#39;s the schedule of command.  But there&#39;s another way of using time that&#39;s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can&#39;t write or program well in units of an hour.  That&#39;s barely enough time to get started.

[Live asynchronously.](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea#.5hnnkmdmr)

&gt; Last year I turned off all my notifications. I stopped booking meetings. I started living asynchronously.Now instead of being interrupted throughout the day — or rushing from one meeting to the next — I sit down and get work done.</description>
