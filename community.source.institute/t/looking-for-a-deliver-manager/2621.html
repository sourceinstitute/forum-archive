          <h1>Answers to question we got from some of you, so far:</h1>
<p><strong>What’s the hiring process:</strong><br>
For a hiring decision to be made we need at the very least 4 yes answers from the 3 partner (<a class="mention" href="https://community.source.institute/u/salim">@salim</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://community.source.institute/u/bart">@bart</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://community.source.institute/u/lino">@lino</a>) and the other person holding a DM role - <a class="mention" href="../../u/andonov.html">@andonov</a>.<br>
This means that there will meetings with all 4 people and we’ll assign you a small project that you can do in a week in your spear time. The project will be a live deliverable from our work and we’ll pay you for it.<br>
You never know anyone properly until you’ve worked with them and the goal is to get this mutual understanding kickstarted.<br>
At the end we’ll run some kind of convergence process and hire up to one candidate. Everyone else who requests it will be given feedback.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the 1 most important thing for Source when choosing who to hire?</strong><br>
Frankly we can execute out current projects with the existing team, but feel that now is the best time to make some fundamental investments in our growth and thus are looking to hire some key full time people to support the long term development of the company.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the on-boarding process?</strong><br>
You’ll be reporting to <a class="mention" href="../../u/andonov.html">@andonov</a> once you get hired, who’s an accomplished people manager and is the person currently holding the role you’ll be doing. You’ll run a project together where you’ll be trained and coached by him very closely. After that you’ll be expected to be able to take on the functions and run projects yourself with more limited guidance and support. Once you’ve proven that you can hold the necessarily responsibilities you’ll be considered a peer of Niki Andonov.</p>
<p><strong>Where will I work from?</strong><br>
Source is a remote organization so everyone works from where they like. If you’d like we’ll cover the cost of a desk in a co-working space.<br>
The way we operate is through a number of online tools where we stay in touch on a daily basis.<br>
Additionally 3-4 times a year we do a “Source Camp”, which is half week retreat, where we gather together somewhere in nature and work on strategic things, exchange skills and know how and develop our interpersonal relationships. The team also basically lives in the same house on site during delivery weeks.<br>
A rough assessment is that one would need to be on delivery somewhere in the world about 3 months a year and is free to be where-ever they want the rest of the time. Delivery weeks are very intense and we work almost around the clock with a lot of social team time involved to unwind. During non delivery time it’s quite more relaxed and flexible.</p>
<p><strong>How big is the Source team?</strong><br>
We have a very small core team of dedicated people of which you’d the 5th member.<br>
Additionally the legwork of our delivery projects is executed by our trained facilitators who’re experienced business leaders and take C-level jobs, are founders of startups, accomplished writers and educators or are VCs. That covers another 10-15 people.<br>
And on top of that we have support staff who are external contractors who handle things like:<br>
admin, accounting, legal, graphic design, web development, etc.</p>
