<p>Anyone working in Agriculture knows that hiring in this field can be very different than hiring for office work. This is a critical element of scalability. You might have a great product or service, but if you don‚Äôt have the right team representing you in the fields and rural areas, you can‚Äôt function and you certainly can‚Äôt <a href="../growing-your-team/156.html">grow</a>.</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="VayJAAU0p6M" data-youtube-title="Hiring in the Field" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Hiring</span> the Right People<br>
Brian Bett‚Äôs company Illuminum Greenhouses Kenya has developed a business around not just manufacturing greenhouses, drip irrigation systems, and the sensor arrays which go along with them, but on servicing those farmers with agronomists in the field. Doing that requires hiring both the agronomists and the technicians required to build greenhouses and irrigation systems.</p>
<p>These people are the face of the business and their performance makes or breaks it. Here‚Äôs how Bett hires them:</p>
<p>##<span class="hashtag">#1:</span> Ask your partners for introductions and references.<br>
This is going to get you your first, and likely best, people to start off in the hiring process. Bett also used facebook ads to supplement that list and find good people.</p>
<p>##<span class="hashtag">#2:</span> Interview to test their knowledge.<br>
Bett and his co-founder quickly learned that a person‚Äôs degrees, or knowledge on paper, didn‚Äôt necessarily translate into a good hire. The interviews he conducted focused on their experiences, how they respond to specific questions about materials or farming practices. Some of Bett‚Äôs best hires had no high school education but performed better than their peers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúHe had done his homework, he had researched, we have a procedure, he did everything as we do but he was not a current employee‚Äù<br>
-Brian Bett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>##<span class="hashtag">#3:</span> Give them a paid trial.<br>
Once you‚Äôre happy with someone based on their interviews, it‚Äôs time to get them into the field and see how their experience works in practice. At this stage you need to pair them with a more experienced employee. They might work with your head technician for 6 months, so it‚Äôs absolutely essential that technician is satisfied with their work. Still, paying them for this trial period helps ensure they take this trial period seriously.</p>
<p>##<span class="hashtag">#4:</span> Do random checks.<br>
‚ÄúMost important, get the clients to rate your staff, so [you] have customer feedback which lets farmers rate the technician on a scale of 1-10. You only stick to those rated 9 and above.‚Äù</p>
<p>Always keep them accountable and aware that you won‚Äôt accept anything but the best when it comes to customer interactions. If those farmers lose faith in your business, that‚Äôs the end. If you show them reliable quality and follow through, they will become loyal customers.</p>
