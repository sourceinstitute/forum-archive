    <title>The Sources - online story-telling between Africa&#39;s successful tech founders</title>
    <link>https://community.source.institute/t/the-sources-online-story-telling-between-africas-successful-tech-founders/552</link>
    <description>The Sources is an online course for African technology entrepreneurs.

It exists to empower entrepreneurs by exposing them to African founders who’ve walked the same path, and does so by sharing typically African challenges and appraoches, right from the source.  It started from an obvious gap in educational material for African markets,
and has been encouraged by well-regarded communities like Techcabal and the
Meltwater Entrepreneurial School Of Technology (MEST).

It develops and demonstrates well-known but underrated type of peer-education -- storytelling -- by bringing it online.

- It creates higher-impact education by covering more relevant topics, and by delivering the education as it’s needed.

- It filters out the most active and ambitious applicants from a high volume of students.
